How to stack graphs one below another in Excel?

Last week, I participated in a data visualization exercise (Link:https://lnkd.in/e3nbPf5W) on #StorytellingWithData to showcase relevant information via graphs. The data provided was performance of "Our company", "Competitive index", and "S&P 500" over past 5 years.

While the line graph, clearly indicated the performance over last 5 years, the comparative change in price was not clearly visible. For this reason, I added the %Change graph with secondary axis to show price movements (Before). However, with secondary axis and stacking them one below another, it was still difficult to read the graph.

The workaround used here was, I simply created two graphs, aligned them vertically and removed X-axis from the top chart. Thus, using a common X-axis for both the graphs, which makes it look together (After).

Do you think the modification helped in making the message clear and easy to understand?

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to write those in the comments.
